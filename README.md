# Implementation of -cluster-based-routing-protocol-using-matlab

here in my code the result is to observe the average throughput vs simuation
code divided into three parts.one is for placing vehicles position randomly.Next is about finding parameters like lifetime,thresold distance other is main implementation of average throughput vs simulation time
